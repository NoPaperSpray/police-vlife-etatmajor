Okay, I've added even more debugging code to `dossier_agent.php`. This time, it will show me the raw value of `$_GET['id']` as soon as the page starts processing.

Please do the following:
1.  **Go to `http://localhost/rpd-hq/agents.php`**
2.  **Click on the "Dossier" button** for *any* agent that appears in your list.
3.  **Copy and paste the entire output** you see on the page into our chat.

This output is crucial for understanding why `agent_id` is becoming `NULL`. Thank you again for your continued patience!
